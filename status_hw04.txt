4. How much of the functionality did you complete?
I implemented all of the features.

5. Did you successfully deploy? If not, what's broken?
Yes, it took me a few hours but I got it going.

6. How comfortable do you feel with Elixir now?
Still need more practice. Definitely gonna have to wake up my fundies
knowledge... I miss iteratives and mutation :(

7. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
Elixir: I'm very used to iterables and performing mutations so I
definitely struggled with the Elixir problems at first. After a while
of hacking away, it was okay though. Not my favorite code language.
Also for some reason, milligram wasn't working locally but when I
deployed it appearred??

Deploying: This sucked. So many different parts â€” missing packages
everywhere, had to go back and reinstall certain things. Hopefully
won't be as bad from here on out. I definitely understand it though.
